## Why Zeno? The Problem It Solves

Zeno targets long-context analysis where a model must understand a large codebase without loading it all at once. It keeps the corpus external and pulls only the small slices needed to answer each question.
For the full narrative and diagrams, see ../../README.md.

---

## What Makes Zeno Different

- Evidence-first: every claim cites a file and line range.
- Recursive decomposition: large questions become smaller, auditable sub-queries.
- Deterministic retrieval: JSONL REPL ops keep context small and reproducible.

Reported results are benchmark-specific: OOLONG shows +28.4% (GPT-5) and +33.3% (Qwen3-Coder), and some settings show up to 2x gains vs long-context scaffolds and up to 3x lower cost vs summarization baselines. Results vary by model and task. (Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601)

---

## Architecture

Zeno runs as a loop between the model and a JSONL REPL server, with a persistence layer that stores state, evidence, and claims. Optional telemetry (OTEL) can capture tool-level traces.

---

## Core Ideas

- Externalize context: keep the corpus in a REPL server, not in the prompt.
- Minimize retrieval: prefer peek and narrow read_file over whole-file loads.
- Evidence discipline: no evidence, no claim.
- Recursive inspection: summarize slices, then consolidate into a report.

---

## The Name

Zeno of Elea framed motion as repeated halving. That mirrors recursive inspection: split a big problem into smaller slices, then assemble the answer.

- The Dichotomy paradox divides a journey in half, then half again.
- The name signals infinite splitting and recursion.
- RLMs treat a too-long prompt as an external environment and decompose it into smaller subproblems.

---

## When to Use Zeno

- Large repos (hundreds or thousands of files)
- Long logs or traces where only a few lines matter
- Audits (security, concurrency, dependency wiring) that require citations
- Any analysis where you want reproducible, evidence-backed answers

---

## Modes

Zeno ships with six explicit operating modes. Each mode has a detailed playbook and output add-ons in `codex/zeno/references/modes.md`.

- codebase-archaeology: Trace where a function or symbol is defined and used across a monorepo with file:line citations.
- security-audit: Systematically scan for vulnerability patterns and build evidence chains.
- architecture-mapping: Recursively map entrypoints, lifecycle, and boundaries without forgetting context.
- pr-review: Review changed files and trace downstream impact in large repos.
- skill-generation: Analyze a tool repo and draft SKILL.md with accurate, cited docs.
- deep-research: Evidence-first research mode for large projects and specs.

Mode helper CLI (optional):
```bash
python3 codex/zeno/scripts/zeno_modes.py list
python3 codex/zeno/scripts/zeno_modes.py plan --mode codebase-archaeology --symbol MyFunc --format jsonl
```

---

## Triggering Zeno (Natural Language Examples)

Zeno activates when you explicitly ask for it or name a mode.

- codebase-archaeology: "Use Zeno codebase-archaeology to trace MyFunc across the repo with file:line citations."
- security-audit: "Run Zeno security-audit on src/ and build evidence chains for any risky patterns."
- architecture-mapping: "Use Zeno architecture-mapping to document entrypoints, routing, and lifecycle for the API service."
- pr-review: "Zeno pr-review these changed files: src/api.py, src/routes.py. Show downstream impact."
- skill-generation: "Use Zeno skill-generation on this repo and draft a SKILL.md with citations."
- deep-research: "Zeno deep-research this project and answer: how does auth flow through the system?"

If a mode needs inputs, include them in the request (symbol name, changed files, or research question).

---

## Indexing (Symbol + Dependency Map)

Optional: build a lightweight index to speed up archaeology, architecture mapping, and PR review impact analysis.

```bash
python3 codex/zeno/scripts/zeno_index.py --root /path/to/repo --out /tmp/zeno_index.json
```

See `codex/zeno/references/indexing.md` for details.

---

## Budgets and Guardrails (Default Behavior)

Default caps (unless you explicitly ask for deeper coverage):

| Resource | Per Section | Per Answer |
|:---------|:-----------:|:----------:|
| Retrieval ops | <=12 | <=30 |
| `read_file` lines | - | <=2,000 total |
| `read_file` per call | - | <=400 lines |
| `grep` hits | - | <=200 per call |
| File capsules | - | <=12 |
| Recursion depth | - | <=2 |

If budgets are hit: stop, summarize, and provide a next retrieval plan.

---

## JSONL REPL Protocol (Summary)

Core operations exposed by the server:

| Operation | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------|
| `list_files` | Discovery |
| `peek` | Tiny previews |
| `read_file` | Specific line ranges |
| `grep` | Pattern-based narrowing |
| `extract_symbols` | Heuristic symbol lists |
| `stat` | File size and timestamp checks |

---

## Output Blocks (Required for Persistence)

Each Zeno response ends with three machine-parseable blocks:

- `ZENO_STATE_UPDATE_JSON`
- `ZENO_EVIDENCE_LEDGER_JSONL`
- `ZENO_CLAIM_LEDGER_JSONL`

---

## Persistence Artifacts (Where the Receipts Live)

**Codex (notify-based):**
```
.codex/zeno/
  state/<thread-id>.json
  evidence/<thread-id>.jsonl
  claims/<thread-id>.jsonl
  snapshots/<thread-id>/<turn-id>.json
  notify.log
```

**Claude Code (hooks-based):**
```
.claude/zeno/
  state/<thread-id>.json
  evidence/<thread-id>.jsonl
  claims/<thread-id>.jsonl
  snapshots/<thread-id>/<turn-id>.json
  notify.log
```

---

## Security and Privacy Notes

- Zeno is read-only by design; the server does not execute arbitrary code.
- Default OTEL prompt logging is off; enable only if required.
- Avoid logging secrets in evidence or claims; redact as needed.

---

## Performance Notes

- Prefer narrow grep patterns and short read_file slices.
- Use stat to skip huge or generated files.
- Expect slower runs on very large repos; Zeno favors reliability over speed.

---

## Introduction
Zeno is a way to read huge codebases without stuffing them into the model's memory. It keeps the big files outside the model, pulls only the few lines needed, and keeps receipts so every claim can be traced back to evidence.
Technical: This is a production-grade Codex skill for evidence-first, read-only analysis over large corpora using a JSONL REPL server, per-turn persistence (Pattern A), and OpenTelemetry telemetry (Pattern B).

## What you are installing
ELI5: You are installing a "rulebook" and a set of helper scripts that make sure the agent stays honest and leaves an audit trail.
Technical: The skill package includes SKILL.md, a JSONL REPL server, notify persistence, OTEL config, log linting, evidence verification, example fixtures, and tests.

## Install locations (Codex discovery)
ELI5: Codex looks in a few specific places for skills, so put the folder there.
Technical:
- Repo scope: `$REPO_ROOT/.codex/skills/zeno/`
- User scope: `$CODEX_HOME/skills/zeno/` (default `~/.codex/skills/zeno/`)
- Admin scope (optional): `/etc/codex/skills/zeno/`

## Quick start
ELI5: Start the librarian, then ask tiny questions instead of big ones.
Technical:
1) Start the REPL server:
```bash
python3 /ABS/PATH/zeno/scripts/zeno_server.py --root /path/to/repo --log /tmp/zeno_trace.jsonl
```
2) Send a request (one JSON per line):
```json
{"id":"req-1","op":"list_files","args":{"glob":"**/*.swift","max":200}}
```
3) Use the results to produce a cited report and end with the mandatory Zeno blocks.

## Pattern A: per-turn persistence (notify)
ELI5: After every agent turn, a helper saves the current state and receipts so nothing is lost.
Technical:
- Configure `notify` to call `scripts/notify_persist.py`.
- The script extracts the three Zeno blocks from the last assistant message and stores them in `.codex/zeno/`.
- It also saves a per-turn snapshot for replay.
- Codex history (`~/.codex/history.jsonl`) is treated as the ground-truth fallback if blocks are missing.
- A checkpoint line is appended to `.codex/zeno/notify.log` on each turn.

## Notify payload (what the hook receives)
ELI5: Codex sends a tiny summary note after each turn so the helper knows what just happened.
Technical: The notify hook receives a single JSON argument with fields like:
- `type` (event name, currently `agent-turn-complete`)
- `thread-id` / `turn-id`
- `cwd`
- `input-messages`
- `last-assistant-message`
`notify_persist.py` reads the last assistant message (and history tail if needed) to extract the three Zeno blocks.

### Expected artifacts
```
.codex/zeno/
  state/<thread-id>.json
  evidence/<thread-id>.jsonl
  claims/<thread-id>.jsonl
  snapshots/<thread-id>/<turn-id>.json
  notify.log
```

## CLI checkpoint signal
ELI5: You can watch a live “checkpoint saved” stream in another terminal.
Technical:
```bash
tail -f /path/to/repo/.codex/zeno/notify.log
```
Each line looks like:
```
2026-01-04T18:11:30Z zeno_checkpoint thread_id=T1 turn_id=U4 evidence=2 claims=2 state_block=True
```

## Pattern B: high-fidelity telemetry (OTEL)
ELI5: This is a live event stream of tool usage so you can replay what happened later.
Technical:
- Enable OTEL in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- Run the collector from `configs/otel-collector.yaml`.
- The collector writes JSONL for replay and audit.
- Pattern A is the authoritative checkpoint even if OTEL is down.
- Pattern B adds high-resolution tool-level detail for audits and analytics.

## Context bridge (carry forward Zeno state)
ELI5: This prints a small “memory card” you can paste into the next prompt.
Technical:
```bash
python3 scripts/zeno_context_bridge.py --zeno-root /path/to/repo/.codex/zeno
```
Optional flags:
- `--thread-id T1` to select a specific thread
- `--max-evidence 5` / `--max-claims 5` to control size
- `--json` for machine-readable output

## Flags and help
ELI5: The helper scripts accept flags; `--help` shows them.
Technical:
```bash
python3 scripts/zeno_context_bridge.py --help
python3 scripts/zeno_client.py --help
```
Common flags:
- `zeno_context_bridge.py`: `--zeno-root`, `--thread-id`, `--max-evidence`, `--max-claims`, `--json`
- `zeno_client.py`: `send|tail`, `--op`, `--args`, `--request`, `--pretty`, `--log`, `--lines`, `--follow`

## Non-interactive mode (automation)
ELI5: This still works even if Codex runs in the background.
Technical: The notify hook and OTEL export work in interactive TUI sessions and `codex exec` automation runs, as long as the config keys are set.

## Config: minimal example (verbatim)
ELI5: This tells Codex to save a checkpoint after every turn and to keep a history buffer.
Technical:
```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml

notify = ["python3", "/ABS/PATH/zeno/scripts/notify_persist.py"]

[history]
max_bytes = 104857600 # 100 MiB (drops oldest entries when compacting)

[otel]
environment = "prod"
exporter = "otlp-http"
log_user_prompt = false  # privacy default
```

## What the skill enforces
ELI5: It forces the agent to show its work and stop if it is guessing.
Technical:
- Read-only behavior
- Budgets for retrieval and line counts
- Evidence Ledger and Claim Ledger
- Strict output schema
- Mandatory end-of-turn JSON/JSONL blocks

## Scripts included
ELI5: These scripts are the "tools" that make the system reliable.
Technical:
- `scripts/zeno_server.py`: JSONL REPL server
- `scripts/notify_persist.py`: persistence on `agent-turn-complete`
- `scripts/zeno_client.py`: tiny CLI for requests and log tailing
- `scripts/zeno_context_bridge.py`: emit a summary block for the next prompt
- `scripts/log_lint.py`: validate ledgers and budgets
- `scripts/rotate_history.py`: rotate JSONL files by size
- `scripts/verify_evidence.py`: validate evidence references against disk

## References
ELI5: These docs explain the data formats, security, and operations.
Technical:
- `references/protocol.md`: JSONL protocol and op schemas
- `references/data_model.md`: canonical evidence/claim/state schemas
- `references/security.md`: threat model and privacy defaults
- `references/otel.md`: OTEL setup and collector guidance
- `references/troubleshooting.md`: common issues and fixes
- `references/recipes.md`: copy/paste retrieval recipes

## Tests
ELI5: Tests make sure the "receipt" system works.
Technical:
```bash
cd /ABS/PATH/zeno
python3 -m pytest -q
```

## Security and privacy
ELI5: Do not leak secrets into logs.
Technical:
- Default `otel.log_user_prompt = false`.
- Avoid logging secrets in evidence/claims.
- Use redaction if paths include sensitive identifiers.

## Troubleshooting
ELI5: If something fails, check the log and the block format.
Technical:
- Ensure the assistant emitted all three Zeno blocks in the right order.
- Check `~/.codex/history.jsonl` and `.codex/zeno/` outputs.
- Run `scripts/log_lint.py` to catch structural errors.
